# Tyler's Prework Study Guide

## Description

This study guide was designed to keep track of generalized note I took during my prework process, for a full-stack coding bootcamp, through the University of Washington. I was motivated to do so not only as it was a part of the bootcamp experience, but also because I was driven to learn as much as I could about coding for web development. This s the first web page I have created and the experience has taught me a lot and that I still have a lot to learn.
Thank you to whoever is reading this, even if its only me.

## Usage

To use this study guide, first navigate to it by following this link https://onedeadfox.github.io/prework-study-guide/index. Next decide what topic you would like to see some refresher notes on out of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. If you're having trouble deciding you can have the site pick for you by opening the developer tools. Right-click, select 'inspect', in the developer tools window that opens, click the console tab, and then realize that this functionality has not been implemented as I either neglected to save or I saved over my progress. So umm... That will be a feature in a future update.
